#Write a code snippet that inputs a sentence from the user, then uses a dictionary to summarize the number 
#of occurrences of each letter. Ignore case, ignore blanks and assume the user does not enter any punctuation. 
# Display a two-column table of the letters and their counts with the letters in sorted order. Example Input 
# This is a sample text with several words This is more sample text with some different words Output
