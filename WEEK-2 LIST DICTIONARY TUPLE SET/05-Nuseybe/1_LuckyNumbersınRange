#1.Write a programme to generate the lucky numbers from the range(n). These are generated starting with the sequence 
# s=[1,2,...,n]. At the first pass, we remove every second element from the sequence, resulting in s2. At the second pass,
#we remove every third element from the sequence s2, resulting in s3, and we proceed in this way until no elements can be 
# removed. The resulting sequence are the numbers lucky enough to have survived elimination. The following example describes
# the entire process for n=22 Original sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] 
# Remove 2nd elements [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21] Remove 3rd elements [1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 19, 21] 
# Remove 4th elements [1, 3, 7, 13, 15, 19] Remove 5th elements [1, 3, 7, 13, 19] We cannot remove every other 6th element 
# as there is no 6th element. Input 22 Output Lucky numbers are [1, 3, 7, 13, 19]
