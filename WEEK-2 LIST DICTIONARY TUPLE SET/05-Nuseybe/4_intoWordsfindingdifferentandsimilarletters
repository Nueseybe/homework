#Write a program that takes in two words as input and returns a list containing three elements,
# in the following order Shared letters between two words. Letters unique to word 1. Letters 
# unique to word 2. Each element of the output should have unique letters, and should be 
# alphabetically sorted. Use set operations. The strings will always be in lowercase and will not 
# contain any punctuation. Example Input1 sharp Input2 soap Output ['aps', 'hr', 'o']
