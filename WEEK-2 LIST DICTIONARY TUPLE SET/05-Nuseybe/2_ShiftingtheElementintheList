#Write a program that takes two inputs; one of them is a list and the other is a number, and returns the list obtained by shifting the elements in the list n places to 
#the right (left) when n is positive (negative). Use wrap-around if an element is shifted beyond the end of the list,
#then continue to shift starting at the beginning of the list
#making list with number, which is user input

nlist1=list( range (1,nlist+1))# calculating indexes of numbers
print(f"list : {nlist1}") # printing list 
print(f"number:{num}")  
if num >0 : print(nlist1[nlist-num:] + nlist1[:(nlist-num)]) # Calculating whether the number is positive or negative and if number is pozitive, calculating new index 
else : print(nlist1[-1*(nlist+num):] + nlist1[:-1*(nlist+num)])
