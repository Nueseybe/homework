Application : Shifting

Explanation : Shifting is an application where a list is created by the user and in that list, user decides how much the elements in that list shift towards right or left.
To shift elements towards right, user needs to enter a positive input and to shift left, a negative input is required.
'''

print('Your list should include at least 2 numbers')

n = list(map(int, input("You can enter your list putting a space between numbers:").split(' '))) #to create list
print('This is your list:',n)

print('Note:To shift left, input negative')

a = n.copy() #created copy of the list to apply changes on it and equalize indexes with each other

b = int(input("How much do you want to shift:"))        

for i in range(len(n)):

    a[(b + i) % len(n)] = n[i]  

print('Entered list:',n) #to print desired outputs

print('Shifted list:',a)
