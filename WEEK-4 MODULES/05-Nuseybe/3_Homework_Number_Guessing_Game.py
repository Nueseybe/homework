#Number Guessing Game
# As a player, I want to play a game which I can guess a number the computer chooses in the range I chose.
#  So that I can try to find the correct number which was selected by computer.
# Acceptance Criteria:
# Computer must randomly pick an integer from user selected a range, i.e., from A to B, where A and B belong to Integer. 
# Your program should prompt the user for guesses if the user guesses incorrectly, it should print whether the guess is too high or too low.
#  If the user guesses correctly, the program should print total time and total number of guesses. 
# You must import some required modules or packages You can assume that the user will enter valid input. (use import random and time)
