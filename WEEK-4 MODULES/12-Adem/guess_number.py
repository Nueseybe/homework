#It is desired to determine in which number ranges the game should be.
l_limit = int(input("Please Enter Lower Limit!!"))
u_limit = int(input("Please Enter Upper Limit"))

#In these intervals, a number is selected by the computer.
number =random.randint(l_limit, u_limit)

start = time.time()

number_guess = 0
#The game starts and the first choice is requested. The program cycle continues.
